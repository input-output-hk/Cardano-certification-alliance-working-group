## Abstract

Cardano Threat Intelligence (CTI) is a crucial practice that involves gathering and analyzing information to proactively identify and mitigate potential threats to the Cardano blockchain platform. CTI utilizes a categorization system in a community-led repository, organizing vulnerabilities and weaknesses based on Cardano's different layers (on-chain, off-chain, network, and miscellaneous). Each issue is assigned a reference number by the CTI for easy identification.

Threat intelligence in Cardano is gathered through diverse methods, including monitoring online communities, analyzing network traffic, collaborating with experts, and conducting threat modeling exercises. The CTI Watchdogs, a group of cybersecurity, blockchain, and threat analysis experts, play a vital role in managing CTI and maintaining the security and integrity of the Cardano ecosystem.

The benefits of Cardano Threat Intelligence are significant, enabling early threat identification, enhanced network security, mitigation of financial and reputational risks, and staying ahead of emerging threats and vulnerabilities.

Implementing a Cardano Threat Intelligence framework is essential to safeguard the ecosystem. By leveraging threat intelligence practices and maintaining a well-organized repository, the Cardano community can proactively address vulnerabilities or weaknesses and ensure the ongoing security and trustworthiness of the network.

## Motivation: why is this CIP necessary?

This CIP addresses the growing importance of security within the Cardano blockchain ecosystem. As Cardano gains popularity, it becomes a target for malicious actors seeking to exploit vulnerabilities and compromise the platform's integrity. The primary goal of this CIP is to establish a dedicated framework for Cardano Threat Intelligence (CTI) that proactively identifies, analyzes, and mitigates potential threats and vulnerabilities. By implementing a structured approach, the Cardano community can stay ahead of evolving security risks and ensure the continued resilience and trustworthiness of the network.

CTI plays a crucial role in enhancing the overall security posture of Cardano. It enables early detection and assessment of potential threats, facilitating prompt actions to prevent or mitigate their impact. CTI also encourages collaboration among security researchers, experts, and stakeholders, fostering a collective effort to maintain the platform's security. By exchanging information and insights, the community stays informed about emerging threats and evolving attack techniques.

Furthermore, CTI includes post-mortem analysis to properly document exploited vulnerabilities. This analysis provides valuable insights into the root causes, impact, and remediation strategies associated with security incidents. It contributes to continuous improvement in security practices and strengthens the overall robustness of the Cardano ecosystem.

Through the formalization of the Cardano Threat Intelligence framework in this CIP, we aim to create a standardized and community-driven approach to threat intelligence. This empowers the community to actively contribute to threat identification, analysis, and mitigation, establishing a proactive and robust security ecosystem for Cardano's sustained growth and success.

Additionally, any relevant certifications or qualifications held by the individuals or team may be mentioned.

#### Short Summary

The Short Summary section provides a brief overview of the vulnerability/weakness finding. It includes a descriptive title that accurately summarizes the nature of the identified vulnerability/weakness.

#### Description

The Description section offers a detailed account of the vulnerability/weakness, encompassing the affected system or software and the method through which it was discovered. It may include relevant background information that aids in stakeholders' understanding of the problem. The impact of the vulnerability/weakness is also described in clear and concise language.

#### Risk Assessment

- **Likelihood:** The probability of the vulnerability/weakness being exploited or an attack being successful. The Likelihood levels can be defined as follows:
  - **Low:** The likelihood of a vulnerability/weakness being exploited is considered low, either because the vulnerability/weakness is difficult to find or because it would require a sophisticated attacker to exploit it.
  - **Medium:** The likelihood of a vulnerability/weakness being exploited is considered medium, meaning that an attacker with some level of skill could potentially exploit it.
  - **High:** The likelihood of a vulnerability/weakness being exploited is considered high, meaning that an attacker with minimal skill could potentially exploit it.

- **Difficulty:** The difficulty of exploiting the vulnerability/weakness, including the level of skill and resources required by an attacker to carry out an attack.The Difficulty  levels can be defined as follows:
  - **Low:** The difficulty of exploiting a vulnerability/weakness is considered low, meaning that the attacker could easily exploit the vulnerability/weakness with minimal resources.
  - **Medium:** The difficulty of exploiting a vulnerability/weakness is considered medium, meaning that the attacker would require some level of expertise or resources to exploit it.
  - **High:** The difficulty of exploiting a vulnerability/weakness is considered high, meaning that the attacker would require significant expertise or resources to exploit it.

Combining likelihood and difficulty factors can help to determine the overall risk level of a vulnerability/weakness. For example, a vulnerability/weakness with a high likelihood and low difficulty would be considered a high-risk vulnerability/weakness, as it is both likely to be exploited and relatively easy to do so. On the other hand, a vulnerability/weakness with a low likelihood and high difficulty would be considered a lower-risk vulnerability/weakness, as it is less likely to be exploited and would require significant resources and expertise to do so.

- **Impact:** The potential impact of the vulnerability/weakness on the system, organization, and users, ranging from Low to High.The impact levels can be defined as follows:
  - **Low:** Vulnerabilities/Weaknesses that have minimal impact on system confidentiality, integrity, or availability.
  - **Medium:** Vulnerabilities/Weaknesses that have moderate impact on system confidentiality, integrity, or availability.
  - **High:** Vulnerabilities/Weaknesses that have significant impact on system confidentiality, integrity, or availability.

As part of the risk assessment, it is important to describe the potential impact of the vulnerability or weakness on the organization, as well as any potential legal or regulatory consequences.

- **Severity:** This assigns a level of severity to the vulnerability or weakness based on the risk assessment. The severity levels can range from Critical to Informational. The severity levels can be defined as follows:
  - **Critical:** Vulnerabilities/Weaknesses that pose significant risks and require immediate attention and remediation.
  - **High:** Vulnerabilities/Weaknesses that can be easily exploited with a high impact.
  - **Medium:** Vulnerabilities/Weaknesses that can be exploited with some effort or have moderate impact.
  - **Low:** Vulnerabilities/Weaknesses that require significant effort to exploit or have low impact.
  - **Informational:** Vulnerabilities/Weaknesses that do not pose a significant risk by themselves but may provide useful information for attackers or reveal deficiencies in the security posture of the system.

The severity level is determined based on the combined assessment of likelihood/difficulty and impact. To provide clear guidance for severity levels, the following classification table has been created.
