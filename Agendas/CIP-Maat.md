# Agenda: discuss my CIP draft

I am inspired by the problem of the Summit Hackathon: transparency for governance.

The simplest way to improve transparency in a network is to provide resources for a Transparency Working Group to function.

The membership in the working group is identified by holding a non fungible token.
The token holder is interested in holding the token because it affirms the right to work in the group, which entitles the holder with revenue.

In a simple case, the desirable number of tokens is determined by some proxy of network size and activity, the list of candidates is created by filling a registration form, and the tokens distributed randomly across the candidates.

The treasury of the working group is a function of the number of membership tokens to be minted and labour cost coefficient.

Within the working group, one or two of the following incentive drivers could be used:
the users might want to get revenue (a salary), or they want to get rewards (completing tasks and participating in gig economy).

The activities and roles with the working group are defined by the group members and a charter.
